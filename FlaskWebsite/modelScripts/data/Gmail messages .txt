I have been debating on weather or not we should go for an S-corporation right away. Since we are far from a proven product concept, we should go for an LLC. the cost is the following New York LLC$200$9 (every 2 years)plus $99 fee from the online legal service. Later we can have our operating agreement and TAX ID number. We will also need to open a business account. This is usually free with some banks, and there might be a 7 montly fee no required minimum. Let me know if I can go head and register the company, the name of the company will be cielo education.Thanks.Denis Ocampo <cieloeducation@gmail.com>Jul 20, 2018, 11:27 AMto ?michael?Sounds good to me!
