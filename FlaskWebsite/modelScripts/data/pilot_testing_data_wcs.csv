hi I arranged a provisional site,1
we need to start putting content we can start with our bios and a couple of blog posts,1
we can work on the design later ,1
 the form is there but it seems like is not working,1
I have to solve that,1
also can you send me the social media accounts,1
so we can link to the site ,1
 also I want to offer the site content in different languages we should position the company as a global company since the start,1
the site looks good,1
here are social media accounts,1
 and yes I agree offering the site in different languages as well as making it a global company ,1
we do not want to limit ourselves to just one market,1
thanks that is just a standard template but we definitely need to design it more,1
hey Michael look at this website I found while reading an article,1
this is what we want to do but on a different level,2
hey Michael how is it going,2
